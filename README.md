# 21/27-crypto-price

This project involves building a web application that displays cryptocurrency
prices. (wanted to make this "real-time", but could not find any `free apis`
that could provide real time data)

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and for styling
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
and will use
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/api](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) api to
fetch crypto price.
